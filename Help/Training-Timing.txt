Description:
It is my the first mutator :) Mutator is made with a view of training 
the control of items (That actually in duels). If you have not time to take 
an item within several seconds after it spawns you are dead.
In mind, it should force to go on item.

Note!!! Mutator doesn't work on network clients.
Use only in Practice (Instant Action) or Listen Server.

Installation:
Extract *.u and *.ucl files from archive to your UT2004/System folder.

Configure:

Dwelling Time is time, after spawn of a item, during which it is necessary
to take a item (in seconds).

Safe Pickup Distance - if the distance (in UU) between you and a item 
will be less than this value you will not die even if Dwelling Time has expired 
(i.e. you as though supervise this item and want to take it hardly later
that has failed so, that the following respawns of items was came to one time).

Controlled Items - items which we are going to control.
